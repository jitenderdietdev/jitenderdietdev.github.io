This information includes, but is not limited to, information relating to how an End User uses that Developer’s application(s). In addition, Developers may enable certain features of the Services that will allow Crashlytics to collect some End Users’ personally identifiable information, as well as whether the End User installed or used the Developer’s application and feedback that End Users voluntarily provide. For example, (i) a Developer may provide Crashlytics with an End User’s email address so that Crashlytics can invite the End User to test a particular version of the Developer’s application, and the End User may download that application and submit feedback about it and (ii) a Developer may choose to append custom metadata to crash reports that they send to Crashlytics from their applications; Developers may choose to include personally identifying information about End Users in this metadata, like name or email address, so that Developers can, for example, contact such End Users to troubleshoot issues with Developers’ applications.

We require that all Developers maintain a privacy policy that fully and accurately discloses the type of information collected, and that the information is shared with third party service providers like Crashlytics.
